### Before you contribute

As part of filing a pull request we ask you to
sign off the [Developer Certificate of Origin](https://developercertificate.org/) (DCO).
The DCO is necessary mainly because you own the copyright to your changes,
even after your contribution becomes part of our codebase, so we need your
permission to use and distribute your code. We also need to be sure of
various other things -- for instance that you'll tell us if you know that
your code infringes on other people's patents.

Coordinating up front makes it much easier to avoid
frustration later on.

### Code reviews

All submissions, including submissions by project members, require review. We
use Github pull requests for this purpose.

### In short

The modular nature of this library should hopefully make it easy for anyone to
add in the functionality they need without getting too muddled.

- Write unit tests
- Make sure they pass
- Follow the linting styleguide
- Document it
